# Data analysis
Folder for analysis of twitter data, personal twitter data and data from several accounts. We also plan to analyse hashtags activity and propagation of openscience through networks of twitter followers. 
We also study here the birth and death of hashtags, which are often led by external events.

As another alternative we plan to analyze threads of Polymath project e.g. https://dustingmixon.wordpress.com/2019/03/23/polymath16-twelfth-thread-year-in-review-and-future-plans/#comment-23695

Hackathon which started from the visit of Lisa Hehnke from Correlaid.
