# Data analysis

Here we analyze different types of data 
1. Twitter data, personal twitter data and data from several accounts. We also plan to analyse hashtags activity and propagation of openscience through networks of twitter followers. 
We also study here the birth and death of hashtags for global hashtags. Birth is often led by external events.
Retrieving the information from twitter data https://perrystephenson.me/2018/08/05/retrieving-bulk-twitter-data/ 

2. As another alternative we plan to analyze threads of Polymath project e.g. https://dustingmixon.wordpress.com/2019/03/23/polymath16-twelfth-thread-year-in-review-and-future-plans/#comment-23695


3.  Another type of data, which was preprocesses by  Natera Orozco, Luis Guillermo, 2019, "Multiplex urban networks", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/GSOPCK, and data made public from openstreetmaps here

These are results from discussions (mini hackathon) which started from the visit of Lisa Hehnke from Correlaid.
They are done on the dataset, which Lisa shared from her work
